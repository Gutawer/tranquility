# Tranquility
A tactical realism mod for Doom, inspired by *Hideous Destructor* ("HD"), *Receiver*, *Arma*, and other games which don’t forgive. 

Tranquility [already exists in limited form on the ZDoom forums](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=46650), and received a positive response from various people. This is a complete refactor of the basic idea to encompass as many advanced "realism" features as possible while maintaining smooth, intuitive playability. Also a proof-of-concept for various game concepts which I’ve had over the years.
