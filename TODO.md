# ToDo

* Improve generic sight artwork.
* Set up states to properly pass-forward sight sprites into the generic overlay states using “----” so new weapons don’t have to duplicate overlays.
* Implement smooth step-based movement code in ACS

# Completed

* Refactor angle-getting to a single script, use args to specify which angle to get. 
* Set up GitHub repository
