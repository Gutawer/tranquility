# ToDo

* Refactor angle-getting to a single script, use args to specify which angle to get. 
* Improve generic sight artwork.
* Set up states to properly pass-forward sight sprites into the generic overlay states using “----” so new weapons don’t have to duplicate overlays.

# Completed

* Set up GitHub repository
